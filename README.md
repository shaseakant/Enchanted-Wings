Enchanted Wings: Marvels of Butterfly Species

Enchanted Wings is a deep learning-based project designed to classify butterfly species based on their wing patterns, colors, and structures. It automates the visual identification process, supporting ecological research, species tracking, and biodiversity studies.


• Problem Statement


Manual identification of butterfly species is a time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge in entomology. Misidentification can hinder conservation efforts and data accuracy. Enchanted Wings solves this by using a CNN-based image classifier that automatically detects and classifies butterfly species from wing images.


• Real-World Applications

Wildlife Research & Conservation: Rapid species identification in the field, supports biodiversity mapping, helps track endangered species

Education & Citizen Science: Assists hobbyists, students, and nature enthusiasts, encourages citizen science with AI-powered species recognition

Museums & Entomology Collections: Digitally organizes butterfly specimens, verifies species in historical image archives


• Technologies Used

TensorFlow 2.14 / Keras 2.14

Transfer Learning with ResNet50

Flask (Python Web Framework)

Google Colab for model training

HTML & CSS for the user interface


• Results
The model achieves strong accuracy using ResNet50 and is capable of classifying butterfly species such as: Monarch, Swallowtail, Painted Lady, Blue Morpho, and more, with high confidence and minimal error.

• Dataset
Butterfly Species Dataset from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification
Butterfly Image Classification (75 Classes)
Contains labeled folders with butterfly images across 75 species, curated and organized for image classification tasks.

• Future Scope

Add real-time camera prediction for field use

Develop a mobile app for outdoor butterfly identification

Add a user feedback loop for mislabeled species

Upgrade model using EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, or YOLOv8

Add geolocation tagging for habitat and conservation tracking
