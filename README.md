Enchanted Wings: Marvels of Butterfly Species:-

Enchanted Wings is a deep learning-based project designed to classify butterfly species based on their wing patterns, colors, and structures. It automates the visual identification process, supporting ecological research, species tracking, and biodiversity studies.

Problem Statement:-

Manual identification of butterfly species is a time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge in entomology. Misidentification can hinder conservation efforts and data accuracy.
Enchanted Wings solves this problem using a CNN-based image classifier that automatically detects and classifies butterfly species from wing images.


Real-World Applications:-

Wildlife Research & Conservation:
Rapid species identification in the field
Supports biodiversity mapping and tracking endangered species
Education & Citizen Science:
Assists hobbyists, students, and nature watchers in learning about butterflies
Engages non-experts in data collection with AI-powered identification
Museum & Entomology Collections:
Digitally organize butterfly specimens by species
Cross-check historical specimen images for correct labeling


Technologies Used:-

TensorFlow 2.14 / Keras 2.14
erro.
fer Learning with ResNet50
Flask Web Framework
Google Colab for model training
HTML for the user interface


ðŸ“ˆ Results

The model achieves strong accuracy using ResNet50 and is capable of classifying multiple butterfly species such as:
Monarch
Swallowtail
Painted Lady
Blue Morpho
...and more, with high confidence and minimal error

ðŸ¦‹ Dataset

Butterfly Species Dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or self-curated)
> Sample source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification
Contains labeled folders with butterfly images across 75 species, curated for machine learning applications.


ðŸ”® Future Scope

Add real-time camera prediction for field use
Mobile app integration for outdoor butterfly identification
Include user feedback loop for mislabeled species
Upgrade model using EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, or YOLOv8
Add geolocation tagging to support conservation efforts
