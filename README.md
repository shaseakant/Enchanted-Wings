🦋 Enchanted Wings: Marvels of Butterfly Species

Enchanted Wings is a deep learning-based project designed to classify butterfly species based on their wing patterns, colors, and structures. It automates the visual identification process, supporting ecological research, species tracking, and biodiversity studies.

🐛 Problem Statement

Manual identification of butterfly species is a time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge in entomology. Misidentification can hinder conservation efforts and data accuracy. Enchanted Wings solves this by using a CNN-based image classifier that automatically detects and classifies butterfly species from wing images.

🌍 Real-World Applications

🦋 Wildlife Research & Conservation

Rapid species identification in the field

Supports biodiversity mapping

Helps track endangered species


🧑‍🏫 Education & Citizen Science

Assists hobbyists, students, and nature enthusiasts

Encourages citizen science with AI-powered species recognition


🧪 Museums & Entomology Collections

Digitally organizes butterfly specimens

Verifies species in historical image archives


🛠 Technologies Used

TensorFlow 2.14 / Keras 2.14

Transfer Learning with ResNet50

Flask (Python Web Framework)

Google Colab for model training

HTML & CSS for the user interface


📈 Results

The model achieves strong accuracy using ResNet50, and is capable of classifying butterfly species such as:

Monarch

Swallowtail

Painted Lady

Blue Morpho
...and more, with high confidence and minimal error.


🦋 Dataset

Butterfly Species Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification

Contains labeled folders with butterfly images across 75 species

Curated and organized for image classification tasks


🔮 Future Scope

📷 Add real-time camera prediction for field use

📱 Develop a mobile app for outdoor butterfly identification

🔁 Add a user feedback loop for mislabeled species

🚀 Upgrade model using EfficientNet, Vision Transformers, or YOLOv8

🗺 Add geolocation tagging for habitat and conservation tracking
